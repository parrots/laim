LAIM (Latent AIM) is an AIM client which will connect to the network in your place when you log out, giving your friends the ability to still IM you as if you were just set to being away.  Once you log back in LAIM will relay all of the missed messages to you and sign itself out.  It's basically a server-side buddy pounce implementation.

In addition to the basic feature of message collection, LAIM also supports away message scheduling. This allows your friends can have a basic idea of what you are up to when you're not signed in, instead of having only one basic message up all the time.
